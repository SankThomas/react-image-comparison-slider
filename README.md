# React Image Comparison Slider

1. Built in ReactJs
2. No external styling applied except the default stylesheets bootstrapped with `npx create-react-app`
3. Inline styling on the `<div>` that renders the `ImageSlider` component
4. `react-image-comparison-slider` npm package is used for the slider.
5. The component takes in a couple of props which you can read more about [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-image-comparison-slider).

## Demo

- Clone the repository using `git` or download and extract the `zip` file.
- Run `npm install` to install `node_modules` and then run `npm start` to run the development server.
- Try changing the `image1` and `image2` props to the image addresses of the images of your choosing. Experiment with changing the heights and widths, and the other props available to the `ImageSlider` component.
- Remember the `ImageSlider` component is imported as default in `App.js` so feel free to rename it to whatever you would want, and the application should still work fine.

### Why this repo?

- I want to add this to my website and this was a test to see how it works. I also want to make a video about it which you can check out on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeDWS6WbftXe9-6QQFMrKAQ)
